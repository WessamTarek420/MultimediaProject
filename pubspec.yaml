# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Mansalva
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Mansalva-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
     - family: Comic
       fonts:
         - asset: fonts/Comic-Regular.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
